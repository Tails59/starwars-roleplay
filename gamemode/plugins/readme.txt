1) Create a folder with the name of your plugin (MUST be lowercase)
2) Create relevant .lua files within this directory - 
	files starting with sv_ will be loaded SERVERSIDE only
	files starting with sh_ will be loaded on both CLIENT and SERVER
	files starting with cl_ will be loaded on CLIENTSIDE only

Ensure all .lua files are wholly lowercase
